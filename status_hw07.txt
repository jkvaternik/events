Has all the resources. Users can login and create a session,
create, edit, delete and show an event.

DESIGN CHOICE: Times are displayed in 24-hr time.


5. Is your app properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?
Yes. System file was not cooperating but I succesfully debugged it.


6. If you would like the deployment for an old homework to be reconsidered, what
are the links to your Inkfish submission and deployed site?
HW02; there was an error due to deployment and I fixed it. Everything
was displaying but it didn't have the updated code.

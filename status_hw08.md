Web Dev Spring 2021 HW08 Status

Answer the following questions:


1. What's your name?
Jaime Kvaternik


2. What's the URL of the github repo with your work for this HW?
https://github.com/jkvaternik/events


3. What's the URL that you deployed to?
http://events.jk-web.site


4. Is your app functionality complete? If not, what's missing?
Yes, the date-time is a bit finicky. The bootstrap component only
works on Chrome so for now to create events, the user has to type
the date and time on any browser that isn't Chrome.


5. Is your app properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?
Yes. Was tough, but it works.
